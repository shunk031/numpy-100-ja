> ## 100 numpy exercises
> This is a collection of exercises that have been collected in the numpy mailing list, on stack overflow and in the numpy documentation. I've also created some to reach the 100 limit. The goal of this collection is to offer a quick reference for both old and new users but also to provide a set of exercices for those who teach.
